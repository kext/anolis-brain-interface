# Questions

## For the Biologists

### How many electrodes are needed?

This influences how many channels are needed on the PCB.

### What type of electrodes will be used?

How big are they?
How are they attached?
How long and thick are the wires?

### What are the frequencies of the signals?

This determines the sample rate and cutoff frequency used for the ADC.

### How and where should the board be attached?

The board could be attached either on the head or on the back of the lizard.
Will it be glued or strapped to the lizard?

We could include slits at the sides of the PCB to attach a strapping belt.

### How long will the experiments last?

This determines how much battery capacity is needed.

## For us

### Which battery type to use?

We could use either lithium button cells, zinc-air button cells or LiPo rechargeable batteries.

### Can a zinc-air battery supply the needed current?

When using a micro SD card, the power supply needs to be able to supply peak currents of 200mA.
With the lower voltage of the zinc-air button cell of 1.45V vs the 3.3V operating voltage this current increases to about 450mA.

We should conduct an experiment where we discharge a number of coin cells with different currents both pulsed and continuously.
This also can show us the expected operation time for each type of battery.
